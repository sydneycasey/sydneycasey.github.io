## Who am I?

As you could guess from the address and wherever you got this link from, my name is Sydney. I've been full-stack software engineer for almost one year now. Outside of work, I've always had a very curious and creative spirit. I like to dive deeply into an array of different creative hobbies and see what sticks. In my free time, I make music, write poetry, and create other forms of physical art. I'm also passionate about the environment and enjoy spending a lot of time outdoors!

## Why Software Engineering?

When I was introduced to software development, I was intoxicated. Like - Drunk in Love. The sheer vastness of what there is to be discovered in this field is nothing short of fascinating to me. Like I said before, I'm a creative person at heart. But I was seeking a career path that would challenge my intelligence. As a software engineer, I'm able to utilize my creativity and skills in design, as well as my natural ability to understand logic and problem-solving. 


## Okay, that's all great. But why should we hire you?

I have excellent problem-solving skills, a positive attitude, and I'm able to quickly, autonomously pick up new technologies. Forbes has a wonderful article highlighting the [importance of creativity in programming](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christianowens/2019/02/14/move-over-actors-and-artists-software-developers-are-true-creative-heroes/#63af45357127). Along with the points they make, I know developers generally work closely with marketers. I have experience with graphic design and a background in art, so I'm able to effectively communicate with people and make their visions come to life! Beyond that, **here are my technical skills and interests:** 
- React
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra) databases
- Git
- AWS
- ThreeJS (Really cool 3D animation Javascript framework!)

### What have I actually _made?_

**Bandland** | NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, AWS
_Music streaming service which gives the user album recommendations based on their current choice_
- Extended MongoDB legacy codebase with PostgreSQL and Cassandra to support 100,000x more data 
- Benchmarked query times with both databases to determine which was best for my use case
- Stress-tested in both development and production with 500+ RPS to ensure a quality user experience 
- Connected multiple EC2 instances to form a functional proxy server with deployed databases

## What's important to me in a team?

I thrive in a collaborative and fast-paced environment, whether it is remote or on-site. Work-life balance is important to me. I will happily put in extra time and effort to get stuff done but it means a lot to me to work with a company who respects everybody's time and personal lives. I have excellent communication skills and am very easy-going, so I tend to be easy to work with.
